The Veeb Ecosystem will be an application distribution network that allows 
independent developers to sell their software easily over the Internet, 
while simultaneously providing users with a great distribution and update 
system.

While the code is under the terms of the COPYING file, we would appreciate it 
if the project remaind a "kinda-secret" until we are ready to launch.
