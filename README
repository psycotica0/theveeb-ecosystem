The Veeb Ecosystem will be an application distribution network that allows 
independent developers to sell their software easily over the Internet, 
while simultaneously providing users with a great distribution and update 
system.

While the code is under the terms of the COPYING file, we would appreciate it 
if the project remained a "kinda-secret" until we are ready to launch.

== Depends (Debian pacage name in parens)==

* POSIX script interpreter and utilities (coreutils)
* GNUMake (make)
* ANSI C compiler (gcc)
* SQLite3 (libsqlite3-dev)
* Tcl and Tk 8.5 (or 8.4 with TTK)
