OAuth gem is installed.
Need script to get access token and store it.
May need to do server side first.
Need to add oauth GET to install.rb

NOTE: the security of this system relies on the security of test.db
      if an attacker adds data to that database, then anything can happen
      the only real solution to this is per-package signing, which has been
      discussed.
